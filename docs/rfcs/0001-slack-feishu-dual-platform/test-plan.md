# RFC 0001 Slack / Feishu parity test plan

This file contains the progressive test plan for [RFC 0001](../0001-slack-feishu-dual-platform.md). It starts from the Slack product baseline, maps Feishu parity, then names the automation and real-tenant gates that prove the feature is complete.

## One-Screen Summary

| Layer | Reader need                | Stop when                                                                               |

| 1     | Know what must work        | The Slack baseline and Feishu parity levels are clear.                                  |
| 2     | Run the fast local gate    | Unit, route, mock e2e, admin dashboard, and RFC audit commands pass.                    |
| 3     | Prove production readiness | Real Codex coding smoke plus Slack + Feishu evidence pass and admin health is readable. |
| 4     | Diagnose a parity gap      | The failed capability row points to the owning test slice and expected evidence.        |

The default acceptance command set is:

```sh

| Private/direct chat        | Slack DMs are supported as broker sessions.                                                                                       | Feishu private chats are ignored before session creation.                                                                                                         | Product difference       | `test/feishu-platform-adapter.test.ts`, `test/feishu-real-smoke.test.ts`                                                     |
| Bot/self filtering         | Broker ignores its own Slack output and stale bot messages.                                                                       | Feishu ignores bot/app/self group senders before dispatch.                                                                                                        | Parity                   | `test/e2e-broker-part5.test.ts`, `test/feishu-codex-bridge.test.ts`, `test/feishu-real-smoke.test.ts`                        |

| Real Codex coding task     | A real app-server turn edits files in an isolated workspace and proves a check passes.                                            | The same agent loop can be initiated from Feishu after bridge parity; the real coding gate must not rely on mock Codex.                                           | Parity plus Feishu gates | `test/manual/run-real-codex-coding-smoke.ts`, `pnpm manual:codex-coding-smoke -- --json`, `test/feishu-codex-bridge.test.ts` |
| Work status / typing       | Slack shows assistant status through `assistant.threads.setStatus` and falls back to `eyes` reaction.                             | Feishu must show a user-visible working indicator or card/message update and clear it on terminal state; native typing is not assumed.                            | Platform-adapted parity  | `test/slack-assistant-status.test.ts`, `test/feishu-codex-bridge.test.ts`, `test/manual/run-real-feishu-smoke.ts`            |
| Read/unread visibility     | Slack client read/unread is outside bot control; product truth is broker open-inbound / handled state plus posted reply evidence. | Feishu may add bot-message read receipt evidence when permissions are approved; otherwise dashboard open-inbound / handled state is the required product surface. | Platform-adapted parity  | `test/admin-service.test.ts`, `test/admin-react-ui.test.ts`, `test/manual/run-real-feishu-smoke.ts`                          |

| Bounded history recovery   | Slack missed thread messages are recovered and delivered as one batch.                                                            | Feishu history recovery rebuilds bounded context from message history when cursors exist.                                                                         | Parity                   | `test/e2e-broker-part2.test.ts`, `test/e2e-broker-part3.test.ts`, `test/feishu-codex-bridge.test.ts`                         |
| Background jobs            | Async job events wake the same Slack session and admin can cancel jobs.                                                           | Platform-aware job events wake the same Feishu session and admin cancellation remains shared.                                                                     | Parity                   | `test/e2e-broker-part3.test.ts`, `test/job-routes.test.ts`, `test/feishu-codex-bridge.test.ts`                               |

<summary>Layer 2: Fast Local Automation</summary>

- [ ] Run `pnpm format:check`; complete when `oxfmt --check .` reports all matched files formatted.
- [ ] Run `pnpm lint`; complete when `oxlint . --deny-warnings` exits successfully.
- [ ] Run `pnpm build`; complete when admin UI, TypeScript, and static asset copy all pass.
- [ ] Run `pnpm test`; complete when the full Vitest suite passes.
- [ ] Run `pnpm test:e2e:feishu-mock`; complete when Feishu bridge, adapter, fixture replay, and dual runtime tests pass.
- [ ] Run `pnpm rfc:feishu-audit -- --json`; complete when `ok`, `localOk`, and `realTenantOk` are true for the saved evidence bundle.
- [ ] Run `pnpm rfc:feishu-test-plan -- --json`; complete when the capability matrix, proof links, Layer 2 commands, saved smoke report, and RFC audit are all verified.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Layer 3: Real Tenant Smoke</summary>

- [ ] Confirm Slack Socket Mode and Feishu long connection are both ready in one rollout runtime.
- [ ] Run `pnpm manual:codex-coding-smoke -- --json`; complete when a real Codex app-server turn edits `target.txt`, runs `node check.mjs`, and reports `ok=true`.
- [ ] Run `pnpm rfc:feishu-completion-audit -- --json`; complete only when Slack self-regression drive, Feishu self-regression observe, and real Codex coding smoke bundles are all present and sanitized.
- [ ] Confirm Feishu setup evidence records China Feishu, bot identity, `im:message.group_msg=approved`, send-as-bot, card callback, and resource transfer posture without secrets.
- [ ] In the real Feishu group, @bot starts or resumes a session and the broker posts a final text reply.
- [ ] In the same active Feishu session, send a non-@ follow-up and prove it reaches the same session.
- [ ] During an active turn, verify a user-visible working indicator exists: Slack `assistant.threads.setStatus` or fallback reaction, and Feishu typing-equivalent status/card/message evidence.
- [ ] Verify read/unread semantics at the product level: inbound follow-up appears as open/pending broker state until dispatched/handled, then clears or is superseded by final reply evidence; Feishu read receipts are optional only if explicitly implemented and permissioned.
- [ ] In the same group session, exercise rich text, card, image/file inbound, outbound rich/card/file, co-author card callback, `-stop`, duplicate replay, and bounded history recovery.
- [ ] Run `pnpm manual:feishu-smoke -- --base-url <admin-url> --setup-evidence-file evidence/feishu-smoke/feishu-setup-evidence.json --output-dir evidence/feishu-smoke --json`; complete when `ok=true`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Layer 4: Dashboard Acceptance</summary>

- [ ] Slack session rows show human channel labels when available and can resolve a backend Slack permalink.
- [ ] Feishu session rows show a `飞书` platform pill and safe `conversationId/rootMessageId` coordinates.
- [ ] Feishu session details do not show the Slack permalink action until a real Feishu permalink/deep-link contract exists.
- [ ] Mixed Slack + Feishu sessions keep queue state, open inbound counts, auth profile state, token usage, background jobs, and timeline events comparable.
- [ ] Dashboard rows/details expose work status or typing-equivalent state for active sessions, with terminal states clearing the indicator.
- [ ] Dashboard rows/details expose read/unread or broker open-inbound state for unhandled follow-ups, separately from platform-native client unread counts.
- [ ] Admin platform health shows Slack Socket Mode and Feishu long connection independently, including degraded permission posture.
